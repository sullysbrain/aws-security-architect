# IAM Notes

## Basics
* IAM Authorization / Authentication
	* Authenticate: prove user is who he says he is
	* Authorization: does that user have access to do what they are trying to do?


## CLI IAM Commands
- _aws configure --profile myprofilename_
	- This will configure the 'named profile' of the name _myprofilename_
	- For region: **us-east-1**
	- For fourth option: default (just hit enter)
